# 👉  With this script we generate secret keys and pubkeys for ML-DSA-44 and ML-KEM-512:
#   1) the secret keys are stored into ./contracts/keys/keyring.keys.json
#   2) the pubkeys are stored into ./contracts/keys/pubkeys.keys.json

Scenario qp : Create the mldsa44 and mlkem512 keys

# 👉 Here we load the paths of the files that will contain the keys (the paths are inside create-keys.keys.json)
Given I have a 'string' named 'keyring-file'
Given I have a 'string' named 'pubkeys-file'

# 👉 Here we generate secret and public keys 
When I create the mldsa44 key
When I create the mlkem512 key
When I create the mldsa44 public key
When I create the mlkem512 public key

# 👉 Here we move the public keys into a JSON object
When I create the 'base64 dictionary' named 'pubkeys'
When I move 'mldsa44 public key' in 'pubkeys'
When I move 'mlkem512 public key' in 'pubkeys'

# 👉 Here we print out the keys, and the strings containing the paths
Then print the 'keyring'
Then print the 'pubkeys'
Then print the 'keyring-file'
Then print the 'pubkeys-file'

# 👉 Here we store the keys in their respective files
# ‼️ NOTE: these two statements are executed by Slangroom: https://github.com/dyne/slangroom 
Then I send path 'keyring-file' and send content 'keyring' and store in file
Then I send path 'pubkeys-file' and send content 'pubkeys' and store in file
