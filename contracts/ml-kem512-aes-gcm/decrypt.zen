# ðŸ‘‰ With this script we decrypt a message (string): we generate a *secret* using ML-KEM-512, we encrypt the message with AES-GCM using the *secret*. 


Scenario 'qp': load pqc statements
Scenario 'ecdh': load classical crypto statements

# ðŸ‘‰ Here we load the secret key in the keyring (created and stored locally) as well as the AES-GCM encrypted object
Given I send path 'keyring-file' and read file content and output into 'keyring'
Given I have a 'keyring'
Given I have a 'base64 dictionary' named 'ml-kem512-aes-gcm-encrypted-message'

# ðŸ‘‰ Here we do some in-memory data manipulation
When I take 'header' from path 'ml-kem512-aes-gcm-encrypted-message'
When I take 'text' from path 'ml-kem512-aes-gcm-encrypted-message'
When I rename 'text' to 'ciphertext'

# ðŸ‘‰ Here we recreate the ML-KEM-512 KEM from using the secret key and the header of the AES-GCM
When I create the mlkem512 secret from 'header'

# ðŸ‘‰ Here we use the ML-KEM-512 KEM to decrypt the AES-GCM and renamed it
When I decrypt the text of 'ml-kem512-aes-gcm-encrypted-message' with 'mlkem512 secret'
When I rename 'text' to 'cleartext'

# ðŸ‘‰ Here we print out the cleartext (output)
Then print the 'cleartext' as 'string'
