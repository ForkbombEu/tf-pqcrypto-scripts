   "title":"PQC REST microservice: ML-DSA-44 and ML-KEM-512",
   "version":"1.1.12",
"description":"## Features \n\n This is a testbed to experiment with PQC. The REST APIs are powered by [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org), the same code runs on mobile, and in the browser. The microservices can be extended in Zencode, see the playground [Apiroom](https://apiroom.net). This instance offers: \n\n  - ML-DSA-44: secret and public key generation, signature, verification \n\n - ML-KEM-512 + AES-GCM: secret and public key generation, create ciphertext, encrypt a payload using AES-GCM (and the ciphertext), decrypt the ciphertext and the decrypt the AES-GCM \n\n ## Setup create keys, print them, disable the creation \n\n - Genrate your own secret and public keys by clicking on *Setup: create and print secret/public keys > /create-keys*, the keys are stored in *../contracts/keys/keyring.keys.json* \n\n - after generating your keys, if you want to disable the keygen, rename the file *../contracts/create-keys.zen* to *create-keys.off*, you can re-enable it by renaming it anytime \n\n - Print your public keys, *Setup: create and print secret/public keys > /print-pubkeys* \n\n ## REST APIs \n\n ### ML-DSA-44 \n\n Click on *ML-DSA-44* and then click on *sign* to create a signature and *verify* to verify it. \n\n ### ML-KEM-512 \n\n Click on *ML-KEM-512* and then on *encrypt* to encrypt a string and *decrypt* to decrypt it. \n\n ## Zencode Applets \n\n Click on *Applets*, then on any on the links in the sub-menu, and on   ***ðŸ‘‰ Click here to open the applet***   inside the page, to open an auto-generated GUI, offering the same functionality of the corresponding API. \n\n ## Tech stack, repos and playground \n\n - Cryptography provided by [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org) and [Slangroom](https://dyne.org/slangroom/) and implemented in [Zencode](https://dev.zenroom.org/#/pages/zencode-intro?id=smart-contracts-in-human-language) \n\n - REST APIs and Applets provided by [noË‘codeË‘room](https://github.com/ForkbombEu/ncr) \n\n - This instance was generated using: [tf-ncr](https://github.com/forkbombeu/tf-ncr) and [tf-pqcrypto-scripts](https://github.com/forkbombeu/tf-pqcrypto-scripts) \n\n - Zenroom's online playground [Apiroom](https://apiroom.net) \n\n - Our other PQC appplications: [PQSpread](https://forkbombeu.github.io/pqspread), PQC-ready W3C-DID [method](https://dyne.org/W3C-DID/#mldsa44verificationkey), [service](https://did.dyne.org/dids/did:dyne:sandbox.genericissuer:7s4Qq2qE4PGi6oYRBGFTrhh9fbhGvG6AUdmirJ1C1Tzz) and [explorer](https://explorer.did.dyne.org/details/did:dyne:sandbox.genericissuer:7s4Qq2qE4PGi6oYRBGFTrhh9fbhGvG6AUdmirJ1C1Tzz), PQC-ready SSI Solution [DIDroom](https://didroom.com)",
