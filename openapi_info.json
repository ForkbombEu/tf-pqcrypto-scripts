   "title":"PQC REST microservice: ML-DSA-44 and ML-KEM-512",
   "version":"1.1.0",
"description":"## Features: \n\n This is a testbed to experiment with PQC. The REST APIs are powered by [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org), the same code runs on mobile, and in the browser. The microservices can be extended in Zencode, see the playground [Apiroom](https://apiroom.net). This instance offers: \n\n  - ML-DSA-44: secret and public key generation, signature, verification \n\n - ML-KEM-512 + AES-GCM: secret and public key generation, create ciphertext, encrypt a payload using AES-GCM (and the ciphertext), decrypt the ciphertext and the decrypt the AES-GCM \n\n ## Setup: create keys, print them, disable the creation \n\n - Genrate your own secret and public keys by clicking on *Setup: create and print secret/public keys > /create-keys*, the keys are stored in *../contracts/keys/keyring.keys.json* \n\n - after generating your keys, if you want to disable the keygen, rename the file *../contracts/create-keys.zen* to *create-keys.off*, you can re-enable it by renaming it anytime \n\n - Print your public keys, *Setup: create and print secret/public keys > /print-pubkeys* \n\n ## REST APIs \n\n ### ML-DSA-44: \n\n Click on *ML-DSA-44* and then click on *sign* to create a signature and *verify* to verify it. \n\n ### ML-KEM-512: \n\n Click on *ML-KEM-512* and then on *encrypt* to encrypt a string and *decrypt* to decrypt it. \n\n ## Zencode Applets: \n\n Click on *Applets*, then on any on the links in the sub-menu, and on   ***ðŸ‘‰ Click here to open the applet***   inside the page, to open an auto-generated GUI, offering the same functionality of the corresponding API. \n\n ## Tech stack, repos and playground: \n\n - Cryptography provided by https://zenroom.org and https://dyne.org/slangroom \n\n - REST APIs and Applets provided by https://github.com/ForkbombEu/ncr \n\n - This instance was generated using: https://github.com/forkbombeu/tf-ncr \n\n - Zenroom's online playground https://apiroom.net  ",
